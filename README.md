# Assignment-5 VG Sales Data
### Short description 
A Python report showing the application of Data Transformation in Python on VG Sales data. The file provides a step-by-step tutorial on how to find average global sales and sorting into columns using Python MYSQL and Python Pandas. This repository contains Python scripts that show you how to carry out some data processing in python using pandas package and MySQL codes in Python environment by creating a connection to the MySQL databases using sqlalchemy and pymysql. It explains importing data from a CSV file, creating dataframe,  executing basic and advanced SQL queries, and filtering and manipulating data using pandas.
## Getting Started 
To get started with these scripts, Python will be installed along with the required libraries (pandas & pymysql). You will also need access to a MySQL database.
### Prerequisites
Python Notebook, pandas, pymysql, sqlalchemy and MySQL database
### Installing
Clone this repository to your local machine & install the required Python libraries using pip.
## Running the Tests
In order to run the code in Python, you will need go to the task bar and click on "Run" or you can go to cell and click on "Run All"
### Breakdown of Tests
Import pandas package, create_engine from sqlalchemy and pymysql.Confirm that the CSV file can be imported into a pandasâ€™ data frame and check that the data filtering feature works properly.
## Deployment 
Not Applicable because this code will not be deployed on live data.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests
